## Open questions your group is struggling with:
- How to get data from the Entities without breaking clean architecture and without implementing duplicate getter methods in the Use Cases that manage the Entities. 
- Assigning functionality to Managers and Entities as per what best suits their functionality.

## What has worked well so far with your design:
- My design provided good user feedback in the sense that the user can easily see and interact with the data they have created. 
- My design of seperating the text UI by how they will be implemented as activities in Android Studios would save time when I transition from my currerent text UI to an Android application.
