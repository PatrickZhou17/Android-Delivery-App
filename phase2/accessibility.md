# Project Accessibility Report

## my current implementation and plan for future implementation for each principle of universal design.

1. Equitable Use: The two of users using my app, both the delivery man and customer all have similar looking UIs so that there doesn't exist any discrimination. There's also no advantages provided if you choose to spend extra money in my app, so this allows all the users to be on equal playing field. I also provide password hashing to all users in the Database, so all users have the same level of privacy. 

2. Flexibility in Use: I don't have features that follow this principle. But since my app allows travelers who just entered the country to stay in quarantine while still having access to buy things from stores and outlets, I could implement more world wide languages into my app. This allows for people who don't read english fluently to still be able to use my app. 

3. Simple and Intuitive Use: I made my UI fairly straightforward so that users can use my app simply following their intuition. Also, every step of the order placement has a title or header indicating what is the current page for, so that user do not get lost of what they should do. HoIver, my program do not have a formal instruction or tutorial that teaches the steps and caveats when using the app, which is definitely a possible improvement.

4. Perceptible Information:  This application provides adequate contrast betIen essential information and its surroundings by increasing the font of text, so the users are more easy to read. I also use different modes (pictorial and verbal) to emphasize the display of profile. In my program, I designed this app in Android Studio, this application is currently compatible with android devices.

5. Tolerance for Error: I implemented regular expression checks for user information that the user can set for themselves. This catches users from entering invalid data such as phone numbers or car license plates in wrong formats. This is a fail safe feature that prevents the users from not being able to contact each other due to having the invalid contact information. I could also implement a message verification feature that verifies the phone number actually belongs to each user.  

6. Low Physical Effort: In my program, most operations only require the user to click or type on the screen, which are very commons way of using an android phone. So, users are unlikely to get uncomfortable when using the app. HoIver, there are some improvements I can implement. For example, when creating a shopping list, if a user wants to delete a item that has a quantity larger than 1, they need to click the “-” button multiple times to remove all of them. This could be annoying if the quantity of the item is very large. Thus, I can add a feature to allow users to delete a certain quantity of items at once to reduce the repetitive click actions.

7. Size and Space for Approach and Use: I designed a simple and memorable Logo without much detail, so users can easily recognize the App regardless of their body position. In addition, I left enough space among buttons and notifications such that users can reach all components comfortably for any seated or standing user.

## my target users that I could market my program toward. 

my program allows for a delivery men to buy and delivery anything to you. The types of users who could benefit from this are people who are too lazy or don't have time to go outside and buy things for themselves, and people with can't go outside due to either being stuck in quarantine or having disabilities. They can benefit from the simplicity of using my program and also that my app allows items from multiple stores to be bought in one order, which in turn saves them time and trouble.  

## Why my program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. 

Since due limitations of my program and the limitations of my connects, I can't get stores and outlets to partner with my app. This means that delivery men using my program having to physically go to each store to buy each item from the customer's shopping list. This would makes the delivery fee to be very high, which would limit my users. So, my app would not likely appeal to students and minimal wage workers.
